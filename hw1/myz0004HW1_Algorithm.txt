1. Declare variables for height (integer), mass (double), time (double), and velocity (double)
2. Declare constant value of acceleration due to gravity as 9.8 m/s
3. Declare constant value of the conversion from feet to meters as 0.3048
4. Prompt user for the height and read it (using cin)
5. Prompt user for the weight and read it (using cin)
6. Calculate the velocity using the formula: v = g * t
7. Convert the height to meters by multiplying by the conversion constant
8. Calculate the time using the formula: t = sqrt(2 * (h/g)), g being the acceleration due to gravity constant
9. Calculate the kinetic energy using the formula: e = .5 * m * pow(v, 2)
10. Print out the time to 3 decimal places ("The time taken by the object to reach the ground is X seconds.")
11. Print out the velocity to 2 decimal places ("The velocity at which the object strikes the ground is X meters per second.")
12. Print out the kinetic energy to 4 decimal places ("The kinetic energy at the moment of impact with the ground is X Joules.")
